% ABSTRACT
% ==============================================================================

\begin{abstract}
\noindent \textbf{Context:} Topological data analysis (TDA) offers geometric approaches to analyzing market correlation structure through persistent homology. This study investigates conditions under which TDA can reliably detect market regime shifts---not to generate trading alpha, but to characterize \textit{when} correlation networks become unstable.

\textbf{The Problem:} Initial application of persistent homology to mixed-sector equity baskets produced unstable topological features (CV $> 0.65$), rendering regime detection unreliable. The instability stems from correlation heterogeneity: combining assets with different baseline correlations (e.g., Technology $\rho \approx 0.75$ with Consumer Goods $\rho \approx 0.35$) creates noise that overwhelms structural signal.

\textbf{The Discovery:} Through systematic investigation, we identify a \textbf{correlation homogeneity requirement}: topological features become stable and interpretable only when computed on asset groups with mean pairwise correlation $\rho > 0.50$. Below this threshold, features reflect estimation noise rather than market structure.

\textbf{The Result:} Computing topology \textit{within} homogeneous sectors (rather than cross-sector) yields stable features (CV $< 0.45$) that track regime shifts. Machine learning confirms topology captures regime structure ($F_1 = 0.578$) though directional prediction remains near-random (AUC $\approx 0.52$), consistent with efficient market limits on price forecasting. A theoretical bound ($\text{CV}(H_1) \leq \alpha/\sqrt{\rho(1-\rho)}$) motivated by spectral graph theory provides a framework for understanding why correlation homogeneity is necessary for topological stability.

\textbf{Contribution:} This work identifies \textbf{boundary conditions} for applying TDA to financial data: (1) correlation homogeneity as a necessary condition, (2) a practical threshold ($\rho_c \approx 0.50$) for deployment, and (3) theoretical foundations explaining the correlation-stability relationship. The framework is suited for \textit{regime detection and risk monitoring}, not directional trading.

\noindent\textbf{Scope:} This is exploratory research establishing necessary conditions for TDA applicability, not a validated trading system.

\section*{Executive Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}

This study rigorously validates and improves a trading strategy combining graph Laplacian operators with persistent homology for market regime detection. The methodology represents a novel application of topological data analysis to quantitative finance.

\subsection*{Initial Result}

The baseline cross-sector strategy fails out-of-sample validation, achieving a Sharpe ratio of $-0.56$ with walk-forward testing. All variations tested (alternative assets, simplified approaches) also produced negative returns. Statistical significance testing ($p < 0.001$) confirms these results are not attributable to random sampling variation.

\subsection*{Central Finding}

Through systematic investigation across six research phases, we identify the \textbf{primary mechanism}: computing topology \textit{separately} for each market sector (rather than cross-sector) yields stable topological features and \positiverisk{}.

\bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize $^{***}p < 0.001$ (statistically significant)}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Why Sector-Specific Works}

Sector-specific universes exhibit three critical properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Higher baseline correlation} ($\rho > 0.6$ vs $0.4$ cross-sector) from shared fundamental drivers
    \item \textbf{Coherent eigenstructure} (eigenvalue concentration vs dispersion)
    \item \textbf{Stable topological features} (CV $< 0.45$ vs $> 0.65$)
\end{enumerate}

This correlation-stability mechanism:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shows consistency in simulated cross-market scenarios ($\rho \approx -0.97$ correlation-CV across 11 scenarios)
    \item Is supported by machine learning ($F_1$ improves $40\times$, though AUC $\approx 0.52$ indicates weak directional predictability)
    \item Is motivated by mathematical theory (random matrix theory, spectral graph analysis)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Intellectual Honesty}

This work maintains rigorous standards:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Failures reported:} Cross-sector approach, pure threshold rules, directional prediction (AUC $\approx 0.52$)
    \item \textbf{Limitations acknowledged:} Simulated data in Phases 4-5, time period constraints, single methodology family
    \item \textbf{Conservative interpretation:} Machine learning improves regime classification but not directional alpha
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Scope and Value}

This research establishes \textbf{boundary conditions} for TDA applicability---identifying when topological methods can reliably detect regime shifts and when they cannot. The framework is suited for \textbf{risk monitoring and regime detection}, not standalone trading alpha generation. All code, data pipelines, and analysis notebooks are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/adam-jfkhs/TDA} for full reproducibility.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Motivation}

Traditional quantitative trading strategies rely on correlation matrices to measure market risk and construct diversified portfolios. However, correlation-based approaches face a fundamental limitation: they capture only \textbf{pairwise relationships}, missing the higher-order structure that emerges during market stress.

During the 2008 financial crisis, seemingly diversified portfolios collapsed as correlations that appeared stable suddenly spiked to near-unity. Credit default swaps, mortgage-backed securities, and equity markets---assets considered uncorrelated---moved in lock-step, creating catastrophic losses for institutional investors who believed their correlation-based risk models protected them.

\textbf{The core problem:} Correlations measure linear dependence between two assets, but they cannot detect system-wide contagion until it has already occurred. By the time correlation matrices show stress ($\rho > 0.9$), it is too late to reposition.

\textbf{Topological Data Analysis (TDA)} offers an alternative: instead of measuring pairwise relationships, TDA examines the \textbf{shape of the correlation network}—detecting loops, voids, and connected components that signal when markets transition from calm to stressed regimes. Persistent homology, the core mathematical tool of TDA, can identify structural instability \textit{before} correlations spike, providing a potential early-warning system for regime shifts.

\subsection{Research Question}

This thesis addresses one central question:

\begin{quote}
\textit{Can topological data analysis generate tradeable signals through detecting regime shifts in equity market correlation structure?}
\end{quote}

This deceptively simple question requires answering several sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Does topology contain tradeable information?} (Section~\ref{sec:sector}) Or is it merely a noisy re-parameterization of correlations?

    \item \textbf{What drives topology stability?} (Sections~\ref{sec:sector}--\ref{sec:crossmarket}) Why do some markets produce stable topological features while others do not?

    \item \textbf{Can machine learning extract topology signals efficiently?} (Section~\ref{sec:ml}) Is topology fundamentally limited, or poorly exploited?

    \item \textbf{Why does the correlation-stability relationship exist?} (Section~\ref{sec:theory}) Is this an empirical accident or a mathematical necessity?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Core Contribution}

\textbf{The central contribution of this thesis is identifying correlation homogeneity as a necessary condition for topological stability, with a practical threshold around $\rho \approx 0.50$.} Below this threshold, topological features become unstable and untradeable; above it, persistent homology provides reliable regime detection signals.

\subsection{Reader's Roadmap}

This thesis proceeds in two phases: an \textbf{initial failed strategy} (Sections 2--5) and a \textbf{systematic investigation} that transforms the failure into a general framework (Sections 6--12).

\textbf{For readers with limited time:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core discovery:} Section 7 (sector-specific topology)
    \item \textbf{Generalization evidence:} Section 9 (cross-market simulation)
    \item \textbf{Theoretical foundations:} Section 11 (why correlation $\rightarrow$ stability)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For complete understanding:} The initial failure (Sections 2--5) establishes \textit{why} the boundary conditions matter and demonstrates honest scientific methodology.

\textbf{Paper Structure Note:} This document presents the complete investigation. For journal submission, Sections 6 (Intraday), 8 (Variants), and detailed appendix tables would move to supplementary materials, yielding a focused 25--30 page main paper with online appendix.

\section{Cross-Market Simulation Study}
\label{app:crossmarket}

\textbf{Important Disclosure:} Due to data-access constraints, cross-market analysis uses a \textbf{calibrated simulation framework} designed to reproduce empirical correlation levels and noise properties from academic literature. These results are \textbf{illustrative} and demonstrate the theoretical framework's generalization potential---they are \textbf{not live-market backtests}.

Table~\ref{tab:11markets} presents correlation and topology stability metrics across 11 simulated market scenarios, demonstrating how the $\rho$-CV relationship generalizes beyond U.S. equity sectors.

\textbf{Data Source:} All values generated by \texttt{generate\_all\_thesis\_figures.py} using calibrated random correlation matrices. US sector parameters based on empirical studies; international/crypto parameters calibrated to match literature-reported correlation ranges.

Low correlation ($\rho < 0.50$) & 0.48 & 0.62 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Patterns:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{$\rho$-CV inverse relationship}: Simulated scenarios exhibit strong negative correlation between mean $\rho$ and topology CV (Pearson $\rho \approx -0.97$), consistent with U.S. sector empirical pattern ($\rho = -0.95$, Figure 7.2)

\item \textbf{Critical threshold pattern}: The 10 scenarios with $\rho \geq 0.50$ show CV $< 0.55$ (stable topology regime), while the 1 scenario with $\rho < 0.50$ shows CV = 0.62 (unstable regime)

\item \textbf{Cross-asset consistency}: The correlation-stability relationship holds across simulated equity sectors, international indices, and cryptocurrency baskets, suggesting the pattern may generalize beyond U.S. markets if correlation structure is similar

\item \textbf{Threshold transition}: Crypto basket ($\rho = 0.48$, just below threshold) shows CV = 0.62, suggesting $\rho_c \approx 0.50$ acts as gradual transition point rather than sharp cutoff
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Interpretation Caveat:} These simulated scenarios demonstrate that \textit{if} international/crypto markets exhibit correlation structures similar to calibration assumptions, \textit{then} the topology stability patterns should generalize. Actual market validation would require live data collection and backtesting, which is beyond this thesis scope.

\section{Complete Results Tables}
\label{app:tables}

This appendix consolidates all empirical results from Sections 6--11 into authoritative reference tables. All values are sourced from the figure generation framework (\texttt{generate\_all\_thesis\_figures.py}) and verified against \texttt{manifest.json}.

\subsection{Phase 1: Intraday vs Daily Topology}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Phase 1 Results: Intraday vs Daily Persistent Homology (Section 6)}
\label{tab:phase1}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Frequency} & \textbf{Mean $H_1$} & \textbf{Std $H_1$} & \textbf{CV} & \textbf{Sample Size} \\
\midrule
Daily & 4.23 & 2.87 & 0.679 & 1,494 days \\
Intraday (1-hour) & 4.19 & 1.92 & 0.458 & 39,876 hours \\
\midrule
\textbf{Improvement} & $-0.9\%$ & $-33.1\%$ & \textbf{$-32.5\%$} & -- \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize Source: \texttt{manifest.json}, Figure 6.1--6.2}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Finding}: Intraday data reduces topology CV by 32.5\% (0.679 $\rightarrow$ 0.458), but this improvement is insufficient to overcome the negative cross-sector Sharpe ($-0.56$). The fundamental issue is correlation heterogeneity, not sampling frequency.

\subsection{Phase 2: Sector-Specific Topology}

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Phase 2 Results: Sector-Specific Performance (Section 7)}
\label{tab:phase2}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}

\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize Source: \texttt{generate\_all\_thesis\_figures.py}, Figure 7.1--7.2}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Finding}: Sector-specific topology achieves Sharpe $+0.79$ vs cross-sector Sharpe $-0.56$. The correlation-CV relationship exhibits Pearson $\rho = -0.95$ ($R^2 = 0.91$, $p < 0.001$), validating the correlation homogeneity hypothesis.

\subsection{Phase 3: Strategy Variants}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Phase 3 Results: Strategy Variant Performance (Section 8)}
\label{tab:phase3}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}

Momentum + TDA & $+0.92^{***}$ & $+19.2\%$ & $-10.8\%$ \\
Scale-Consistent & $+0.85^{***}$ & $+17.8\%$ & $-11.5\%$ \\
Adaptive Threshold & $+0.88^{***}$ & $+18.5\%$ & $-11.0\%$ \\

\multicolumn{4}{l}{\footnotesize Source: \texttt{generate\_all\_thesis\_figures.py}, Figure 8.1}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Finding}: All 4 variants achieve positive Sharpe ratios ($> +0.79$), with Momentum+TDA best (Sharpe $+0.92$). This robustness validates that sector-specific topology is not parameter-dependent.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Finding}: The $\rho$-CV inverse relationship holds across all 11 simulated scenarios (global $\rho = -0.97$ vs US-only $\rho = -0.95$), suggesting theoretical consistency across correlation structures.

\textbf{Key Finding}: ML improves F1 from 0.014 to 0.578 ($41\times$), but AUC $\approx 0.52$ indicates weak directional predictability. Topology is better suited for \textit{regime detection} than \textit{price prediction}.

\subsection{Phase 6: Theoretical Foundations}

\quad Mean observed CV & 0.453 \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\footnotesize Source: \texttt{manifest.json}, Figures 11.1--11.3}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Finding}: Observed $\lambda_1 = 25.49$ far exceeds Marchenko-Pastur bound ($\lambda_+ = 1.50$), confirming markets are \textit{structured} rather than random. The spectral gap correlates $\rho = -0.974$ with topology CV, providing near-perfect proxy for persistent homology.
